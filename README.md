### iOS 9+ Security Issues

Add the following lines to your project's info.plist file so that your app would be allowed to open WeChat.app.

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
<string>wechat</string>
<string>weixin</string>
</array>
```

Or if security is not an issue to your app, use the following lines.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
<true/>
</dict>
```
